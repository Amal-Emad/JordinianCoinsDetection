The dataset includes 5456 images.
Coin are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise
* Random shear of between -10째 to +10째 horizontally and -10째 to +10째 vertically
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.1 percent of pixels
